# MediaValet API Examples

Welcome to the **MediaValet API Examples** repository! This project provides practical examples demonstrating how to interact with the [MediaValet API](https://docs.mediavalet.com/) using various programming languages and approaches. These examples serve as a reference for developers integrating MediaValet into their applications.

## Features
- Authentication with MediaValet API
- Fetching, uploading, and managing assets
- Searching assets using metadata and tags
- Handling API responses and errors effectively
- Optimized API request handling for performance

## Prerequisites
Before using the examples, ensure you have:
- An active **MediaValet API key** (available via the MediaValet developer portal)
- A development environment with **.NET 8** (or another supported language)
- A valid MediaValet account with API access

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mediavalet-api-examples.git
   cd mediavalet-api-examples
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```
   *(For other languages, refer to specific examples in the `/examples` directory.)*

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```sh
   export MEDIAVALET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   *(Alternatively, configure your API key in `appsettings.json` or `.env` as per the example code.)*

4. **Run the example code:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project Examples/BasicUsage
   ```
   *(More examples can be found in the `/examples` folder.)*

## API Usage
This repository covers the following key API functionalities:
- **Authentication:** Securely accessing the API
- **Fetching assets:** Retrieving digital assets with filtering options
- **Uploading assets:** Sending new files to MediaValet
- **Searching metadata:** Advanced search with metadata fields
- **Managing assets:** Updating, tagging, and organizing files

Each example is documented in the respective directory under `/examples`.
